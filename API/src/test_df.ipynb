    "For the database, in addition to the `label` column should be replaced by a `NN_recommendation` column and will use the models prediction for each application; the output of the neural network (`smote_ey.tf`) should also be used for a `NN_confidence` column, which is a float between 0 and 1 for each row. A confidence of 1 would imply that the recommendation is made with a certainty of 100% (which implies the independence of the prediction value approve or reject)\n",
    "- the output of the model is one neuron, which means that the confidence could be interpreted in different ways.\n",
    "- first, find out which number (0 or 1) corresponds to approved and rejected in the model ouput.\n",
    "- Check literature to see what is the best way to interpret a one-dimensional binary classification output in terms of confidence for neural networks, evaluate between the following possibilities:\n",
    "    - <b>possibility 1</b>: if the output of the neuron is $p$ ($\\in [0, 1]$), then the confidence should be $p$ (or $1-p$, depending on the mapping to approve and reject)\n",
    "    - <b>possibility 2</b>: if the output of the neuron is $p$ ($\\in [0, 1]$), then the confidence should correspond to $(p-0.5)\\cdot2$ (or $(0.5-p) \\cdot 2$, depending on the mapping to approve and reject) which would lead to a confidence of 0% if the model's output is 0.5\n",
    "    - Maybe a better way?\n",
    "\n",
    "Task:\n",
    "- Modify `API/DataLoader_ey.py` in by adding a new function which takes the csv file `Data/german.csv` as input and returns it as a pandas DataFrame with the recommendations instead of the labels and the confidence values (Maybe add an option to also keep the labels, which might be useful later). \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Goal:</b> the dataFrame is filled with the recommendation strings \"approve\" or \"reject\" and with the confidence values. The DataFrame could now be sent to a sqlite database with the pandas `DataFrame.to_sql()` function\n",

There should be a function which saves a database file with the dataFrame from phase 1 to a separate folder & a function which would make it possible to replace the (tables of, evaluate which is smarter for later use)running database with the one created in the seperate folder (resetting).\n",
